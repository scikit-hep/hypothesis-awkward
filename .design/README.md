# Design Documents

This directory contains UX research findings and API design documents for
hypothesis-awkward.

## Directory Structure

```text
.design/
├── README.md          # This file
├── research/          # UX research interviews and findings
├── api/               # API design proposals and decisions

```

## Purpose

- **research/**: Store technical research and UX findings. Topics include
  Awkward Array internals (type system, form system, direct constructors), user
  interviews, and feasibility studies for new strategies.

- **api/**: Store API design proposals, alternatives considered, and final
  decisions with rationale.

- **impl/**: Store implementation decisions that don't affect the user-facing
  API, such as directory structure, module organization, and internal
  architecture.

- **notes/**: Store progress tracking and working notes for ongoing work.

## Naming Convention

- Research files: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-research.md` (e.g.,
  `2026-02-02-numpy-form-research.md`). UX interviews use
  `YYYY-MM-DD-ux-interview-NN.md`.
- API design files: `YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>-api.md`
- Implementation files: `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
