    ----------
    draw
        The Hypothesis draw function.
    st_
        A callable that accepts ``min_size`` and ``max_size`` keyword

    min_size_each
        Minimum number of elements in each draw.
    max_size_each
        Maximum number of elements in each draw. If ``None``, only
        ``max_size_total`` limits the size.
    min_size_total
        Minimum total elements across all draws.
    max_size_total
        Total element budget shared across all draws.
    max_draws
        Maximum number of non-None draws.
